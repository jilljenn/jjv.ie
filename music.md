### Compositions

My prep school project was about [music composition through Markov chains](https://jill-jenn.net/_static/works/un-algorithme-de-composition-musicale.pdf) (in French).

Later, I used a similar Markov chain ([markov.py](https://github.com/jilljenn/markov.py)) to compose the music of the TV show [***La Faute à l'algo***](https://fautealgo.fr).

### Trio ELM

Together with [Sedeto](https://sedeto.carrd.co/) and Lily, we performed [anisongs](https://trioelm.com/) at Japan Expo 2015, Japan Expo Sud 2016, Epitanime, etc.

We made our own arrangements for 2 voices + piano: [Trio ELM](https://trioelm.com/).

In 2020, we were also featured in the Starducks project produced by **Yoko Kanno**: [here is our version of Macross Lion](https://youtu.be/f7t36bKiymo).
