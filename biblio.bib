SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR results were available for 6740 patients (41.6 per cent), with a mean(s.d.) age of 58.2(19.7) years (51 per cent men). The percentage of operated patients with SARS-CoV-2 RT–PCR results available increased over time, from 846 of 3108 (27.2 per cent) between 1 and 15 February, to 1951 of 2510 (77.7 per cent) between 16 and 30 April, showing progressive awareness of COVID-19 infection in the surgical community.Patients undergoing surgery were categorized into five groups: group 1, positive RT–PCR test within 5 days before surgery; group 2, positive RT–PCR test within 5 days after surgery; group 3, positive RT–PCR test between 5 and 30 days after surgery; group 4, positive RT–PCR at least 5 days before surgery; and group 5, negative RT–PCR test(s) or positive RT–PCR test more than 30 days after surgery. Procedures were graded according to a complexity index ranging from 1 to 4 independent of outcomes1. Three time intervals were identified: prepandemic phase, 1 February to 16 March 2020; peak and lockdown phase, 16 March to 15 April 2020; and postpeak phase, 15 April to 19 May 2020.}",
