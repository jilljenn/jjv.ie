### La Faute à l'algo

[<img src="/static/img/fautealgo.jpg" style="float: right" />](https://fautealgo.fr/)

With Michel Blockelet, we wrote & directed a **TV show about algorithms** that take control of our lives → [*La Faute à l'algo*](https://fautealgo.fr) (*Blame the Algorithm*). It was broadcast on the Nolife channel in 2016--2017 and episodes are currently [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/10072326).

Our TV show was mentioned by the [French Senate](http://www.senat.fr/rap/r16-464-1/r16-464-118.html#toc334) as an interesting example of popularization of AI.

The music was composed by [markov.py](https://github.com/jilljenn/markov.py), a Markov chain written in Python.
