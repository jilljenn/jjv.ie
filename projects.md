### Mangaki

![Mangaki](/static/img/mangaki.png)

[Mangaki](https://mangaki.fr) is an anime/manga recommender system in 5 languages, released under the AGPLv3 license. See our [research blog](http://research.mangaki.fr) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mangaki/mangaki).

Using 330k ratings from Mangaki data, we organized a **data challenge** with Kyoto University [[problem]](http://research.mangaki.fr/2017/07/18/mangaki-data-challenge-en/) [[solutions]](http://research.mangaki.fr/2017/10/08/mangaki-data-challenge-winners-en/).

### La Faute à l'algo

![La Faute à l'algo](/static/img/fautealgo.jpg)

With Michel Blockelet, we wrote & directed a **TV show about algorithms** that take control of our lives → [*La Faute à l'algo*](https://fautealgo.fr) (*Blame the Algorithm*). It was broadcast on the Nolife channel in 2016--2017.

Fun fact, our TV show was mentioned by the [French Senate](http://www.senat.fr/rap/r16-464-1/r16-464-118.html#toc334) as an interesting example of popularization of AI.
